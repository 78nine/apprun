AppRun is a JavaScript library for building reliable, high-performance web applications using the Elm-inspired architecture, events, and components.

> [All the Ways to Make a Web Component - May 2021 Update](https://webcomponents.dev/blog/all-the-ways-to-make-a-web-component/) compares the coding style, bundle size, and performance of 55 different ways to make a Web Component. It put AppRun on the top 1/3 of the list of bundle size and performance.

## AppRun Benefits

* Write less code
* No proprietary syntax to learn
* Compiler/transpiler is optional
* State management and routing included
* Run side-by-side with jQuery, chartjs, D3, lit-html ...

AppRun is distributed on npm.
```sh
npm install apprun
```

You can also load AppRun directly from the unpkg.com CDN:

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/apprun/dist/apprun-html.js"></script>
```

Or, you can create an AppRun app by using the `npm init apprun-app` command.

```sh
npm init apprun-app [my-app]
```

## Architecture Concept

* AppRun [architecure](docs/architecture) has _state_, _view_, and _update_.
* AppRun is [event-driven](docs/event-pubsub).
* AppRun apps can be global or [Component](docs/component) based.


You can get started with [AppRun Docs](https://apprun.js.org/docs) and [the AppRun Playground](https://apprun.js.org/#play).

## Contribute

You can launch the webpack dev-server and the demo app from the _demo_ folder with the following npm commands:
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You can run the unit tests from the _tests_ folder.
```sh
npm test
```
Unit tests can serve as functional specifications.

Finally, to build optimized js files to the dist folder, just run:
```sh
npm run build
```
